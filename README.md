# scoop-tools-bucket

üì¶ A custom [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) bucket for shared apps between team members.

This bucket contains custom manifest files for software not available in the main Scoop buckets, including internal tools, CLI utilities, or self-developed apps.

## üì• How to Use

To use this bucket with Scoop:

```powershell
scoop bucket add shared https://github.com/your-username/scoop-shared-bucket
```

Then you can install apps like this:

```powershell
scoop install app-name
```

For example:

```powershell
scoop install lightning
```

## üìÇ Manifest Format

All manifest files are stored in the `bucket/` folder. Each file is a JSON that describes the app, similar to this:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "An example tool.",
  "homepage": "https://example.com",
  "url": "https://example.com/tool.zip",
  "hash": "sha256:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "bin": "tool.exe",
  "shortcuts": [
    [
      "tool.exe",
      "Example Tool"
    ]
  ]
}
```
